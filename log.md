### Day 0: January 2, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Created a practice web page to display snippets of Javascript actions on HTML Canvas. Utilized tutorials resources as starting points, namely from:  http://www.w3resource.com/html5-canvas/ and http://www.w3schools.com/howto/.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ideas, but need to be practical to build portfolio-worthy projects. What if curiosity didn't kill the cat?
