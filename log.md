1. Read the Medium post:https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b 
2. Listened to the Podcast: http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/100-days-of-code
3. Tweeted my commitment:  https://twitter.com/figmentations/status/814944122033344516
4. Got reacquainted with Github by doing the hello-world practice:  https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
5. Starting the freecodecamp course: https://www.freecodecamp.com/map
6. Forked the core Github site: https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code

**Thoughts:** Doing the prep work so I can hit the ground running. It's all about making decisions.

### Day 0: January 2, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Created a practice web page to display snippets of Javascript actions on HTML Canvas. Utilized tutorials resources as starting points, namely from:  http://www.w3resource.com/html5-canvas/ and http://www.w3schools.com/howto/.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ideas, but need to be practical to build portfolio-worthy projects. What if curiosity didn't kill the cat?

### Day 1: January 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Figured out how to get yesterday's progress synced to newly created Github repo for yeterday's Practice File.

**Thoughts:**  So much effort to plan and decide, so little to show for it.  Starting to doubt my demo page idea. Still learning though.

### Day 2: January 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Created slideshow snippet.  Added it to my Practice Demo Example File. Cleaned up a few things.

**Thoughts:** Need to figure out how to display Github code....maybe look into creating Github Page? Update: That was easy, here it is, nothing pretty, but it's live: https://hhoefele.github.io/CanvasSnippets/
