4. Got reacquainted with Github by doing the hello-world practice:  https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
5. Starting the freecodecamp course: https://www.freecodecamp.com/map
6. Forked the core Github site: https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code

**Thoughts:** Doing the prep work so I can hit the ground running. It's all about making decisions.

### Day 0: January 2, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Created a practice web page to display snippets of Javascript actions on HTML Canvas. Utilized tutorials resources as starting points, namely from:  http://www.w3resource.com/html5-canvas/ and http://www.w3schools.com/howto/.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ideas, but need to be practical to build portfolio-worthy projects. What if curiosity didn't kill the cat?

### Day 1: January 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Figured out how to get yesterday's progress synced to newly created Github repo for yeterday's Practice File.

**Thoughts:**  So much effort to plan and decide, so little to show for it.  Starting to doubt my demo page idea. Still learning though.



### Day 2: January 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Created slideshow snippet.  Added it to my Practice Demo Example File. Cleaned up a few things.

**Thoughts:** Need to figure out how to display Github code....maybe look into creating Github Page? Update: That was easy, here it is, nothing pretty, but it's live: https://hhoefele.github.io/CanvasSnippets/

### Day 3: January 7, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Cleaned up and aligned all snippets boxes to one line. Updating Commits getting easier.

**Thoughts:** Life is easier when we keep things simple.  Progress, not perfection.

### Day 4: January 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Started coding a portfolio website...based on a Skillcrush project. Changed top navigation to fixed. Added portfolio section.  Started re-writing the copy.

**Thoughts:** I feel comfortable publishing work in progress, so will wait until next day's progress before posting to Github.



### Day 5: January 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**:  Skillcrush lesson was to create our first Portfolio Site Wireframe Sketch and Design in UXPin.

**Thoughts:**:  All these days of thinking and reworking and figuring out who I am...finally getting close to something that represents me. :)
